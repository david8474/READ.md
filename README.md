# 👋 Hi, I'm David Joseph Rubio

I emphasize strong security, validation, and multi-tool verification practices in every project — ensuring reliable, compliant, and production-ready infrastructure.

Network & Cloud Engineer specializing in secure architecture, multi-enclave network design, and automated cloud-native deployments. I combine traditional networking (Cisco/Juniper) with modern automation (Ansible, Kubernetes) and Infrastructure-as-Code (Terraform, AWS CDK) to build scalable, secure, and well-validated systems.

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 🔐 1. Multi-Enclave Network Architecture (Secure Segmentation + Automation)
Designed a segmented multi-enclave environment using secure routing, ACLs, VLAN/VRF separation, and device hardening. Automated switch and router provisioning with Ansible to ensure consistent, validated configurations. Extended the architecture into AWS using a hybrid VPC design mirroring on-prem segmentation for controlled, secure connectivity.

👉 Repository: `Projects/multi-enclave-network/`

### ☁️ 2. AWS CDK + Terraform Multi-Stack Deployment ($36/month Architecture)
Built a cost-efficient cloud deployment using both AWS CDK (TypeScript) and Terraform. Includes reusable VPC, compute, and storage stacks with layered IaC, infrastructure validation, and security-focused design. Demonstrates IaC fluency and cloud architecture fundamentals.

👉 Repository: `Projects/aws-cdk-terraform-stack/`

### ⚙️ 3. Kubernetes Automated Deployment + Ansible Integration
Developed a production-style Kubernetes setup with automated provisioning, Helm-based deployments, ingress/TLS configuration, persistent storage, and HPA autoscaling. Designed for reliability, secure application delivery, and repeatable cloud-native operations.

## 🔒 Security & Compliance Notice

This profile includes only **safe, representative, placeholder-based code samples**.  
Full implementations — including enclave segmentation logic, routing policies, IaC modules, 
and automation workflows — are stored securely in private development environments 
(Bolt.new / Codex) and are **not published publicly**.

This ensures proper security hygiene while still demonstrating architecture, automation, and design capabilities for review.
